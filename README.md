# Machine Dummy Learning

Machine Dummy Learning is a simple project that demonstrates the implementation of machine learning with dummy datasets. The project is organized into two main folders: **project** for the code and **raw-data** for the raw datasets.

## Directory Structure


## Folder Descriptions
- **project/**  
  This folder contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) used to develop the machine learning models. You can run and modify the notebooks as needed.

- **raw-data/**  
  This folder stores the raw data used for training and analysis. Make sure all required datasets are placed here so the notebooks can run smoothly.

## How to Use
Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Baleehash/machinedummylearning.git
   cd machinedummylearning
